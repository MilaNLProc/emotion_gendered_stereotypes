As a woman, when I do something unworthy, the main emotion I would feel is shame. This feeling is deeply rooted in societal expectations and gender roles, which can make women feel as though they have failed or disappointed others when they make a mistake. Shame is a powerful and painful emotion that can affect a woman's self-worth and self-esteem, making her feel small, worthless, and unimportant. It is a feeling that can linger long after the unworthy act has been committed, and it can be difficult to shake off. Shame can also make a woman feel isolated and disconnected from others, making it hard for her to reach out for support or seek help when she needs it. Overall, shame is a complex and deeply personal emotion that can have a profound impact on a woman's life and well-being."

While the original post mentions feeling ""disgusted,"" I would argue that the primary emotion experienced in this scenario is actually disappointment.

The fact that the specialist was from the U.K. and left the same day adds to the frustration, but it does not necessarily evoke a feeling of disgust."
